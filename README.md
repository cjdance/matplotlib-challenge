## Challenges in Homework

### Remembering notation for .drop function in Pandas.

* Kept encountering errors with column names not found in aixs due to missing the .index from the drop function when informing the code to remove full rows.
* Reviewed previous weekly lessons to recommit to memory and solve issue.

### Remembering output type when finding duplicate mouse ID

* Duplicate mouse ID was put out as a series with an index
* Required to designate only the value inside of it when using later or got an error of comparing series with different lengths
* Resolved after determining location in output, also created print function to programmatically display duplicate mouse ID's from the dat in case there had been more than one
